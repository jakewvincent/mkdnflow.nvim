DESCRIPTION                                             *Mkdnflow-description*

Mkdnflow is designed for the fluent navigation of documents and notebooks (AKA
"wikis") written in markdown. The plugin's flexibility and its prioritization
of markdown also means it can become part of your webdev workflow if you use
static site generators like Jekyll or Hugo, which can generate static sites
from markdown documents.

The plugin is an extended set of functions and mappings to those functions
which make it easy to navigate and manipulate markdown documents and notebooks
in Neovim. I originally started writing Mkdnflow to replicate some features
from Vimwiki in Lua instead of Vimscript, but my current goal for this project
is to make this plugin as useful as possible for anyone using Neovim who
maintains a set of markdown notes and wishes to efficiently navigate those
notes and keep them organized and connected. The plugin now includes some
convenience features I wished Vimwiki had, including functionality to rename
the source part of a link and its associated file simultaneously.

I keep tabs on the project's issues and appreciate feature requests,
suggestions, and bug reports. If you'd like to contribute to the plugin, fork
this repo and submit a pull request with your changes or additions. If you need
Lua resources, see this page for a starting point or run :h lua or :h api in
Neovim.

COMMANDS AND MAPPINGS                                      *Mkdnflow-commands*
                                                           *Mkdnflow-mappings*

Mkdnflow provides the following commands for interacting with the contents of 
markdown files. These are shown in order of importance. Default mappings are
shown for commands that have them.

*:Mkdnflow*
    `Default mapping: none`
    Manually start Mkdnflow. You should generally not need to use this.

*:MkdnEnter*
    `Default mapping: <CR> (Modes: normal, visual, insert)`
    In normal mode, follows a link under the cursor or creates a link from the
    word under the cursor.

    In visual mode, creates a link from the selected text.

    In insert mode, creates a new list item of the same type of the current
    line (if the cursor is in an ordered or unordered list), moves the cursor
    to the same cell in the next row of a table (if the cursor is in a table),
    or behaves like a normal `<CR>` if the cursor is neither in a list or a
    table.

*:MkdnTab*
    `Default mapping: <Tab> (Modes: insert)`
    If the cursor is in a list and the current list item is empty except for
    the bullet point/item number, indents the list item (creating a child of
    the previous list item). If the cursor is in a table, moves the cursor to
    the next cell in the table.

*:MkdnSTab*
    `Default mapping: <S-Tab> (Modes: insert)`
    If the cursor is in a list and the current list item is empty except for
    the bullet point/item number, un-indents the list item (if possible). If
    the cursor is in a table, moves the cursor to the previous cell in the
    table.

*:MkdnNextLink*
    `Default mapping: <Tab> (Modes: normal)`
    Moves the cursor to the beginning of the next link (if there is a next
    link).

*:MkdnPrevLink*
    `Default mapping: <S-Tab> (Modes: normal)`
    Moves the cursor to the beginning of the previous link (if there is one).

*:MkdnNextHeading*
    `Default mapping: ]] (Modes: normal)`
    Moves the cursor to the next heading in the document (if there is one).

*:MkdnPrevHeading*
    `Default mapping: [[ (Modes: normal)`
    Moves the cursor to the previous heading in the document (if there is
    one).

*:MkdnGoBack*
    `Default mapping: <BS> (Modes: normal)`
    Open the historically last-active buffer in the current window.

*:MkdnGoForward*
    `Default mapping: <Del> (Modes: normal)`
    Open the buffer that was historically last navigated away from in the
    current window.

*:MkdnFollowLink*
    `Default mapping: none`
    Open the link under the cursor, creating missing directories if desired,
    or if there is no link under the cursor, make a link from the word under
    the cursor.

*:MkdnCreateLink*
    `Default mapping: none`
    Replace the word under the cursor with a link in which the word under the
    cursor is the name of the link.

*:MkdnDestroyLink*
    `Default mapping: <M-CR> (alt-enter) (Modes: normal)`
    Replaces the link with the link text.

*:MkdnMoveSource*
    `Default mapping: <F2> (Modes: normal)`
    Opens a dialog in the command line where you can specify a name to change
    the link source to. After entering the name change, Mkdnflow will rename
    both the link and the associated file for you. It will confirm before
    renaming so that you have the option to cancel if the name change appears
    incorrect.

*:MkdnYankAnchorLink*
    `Default mapping: ya (Modes: normal)`
    Add a formatted anchor link to the unnamed register (clipboard) if the
    current line that the cursor is on is a heading.

*:MkdnYankFileAnchorLink*
    `Default mapping: yfa (Modes: normal)`
    Add a formatted anchor link with the full file path before the anchor to
    the unnamed register (clipboard) if the current line that the cursor is on
    is a heading.

*:MkdnIncreaseHeading*
    `Default mapping: + (plus key) (Modes: normal)`
    Increase heading importance (remove hashes).

*:MkdnDecreaseHeading*
    `Default mapping: - (minus/dash key) (Modes: normal)`
    Decrease heading importance (add hashes).

*:MkdnToggleToDo*
    `Default mapping: <C-Space> (Modes: normal)`
    Toggle a to-do list item's completion status. To-do item must be in a
    markdown-style list, e.g.:
>
    * [ ] Email boss
    * [ ] Submit résumé
<
*:MkdnUpdateNumbering*
    `Default mapping: <leader>nn (Modes: normal)`
    Fixes the numbering for the list the cursor is currently in. Only updates
    the numbering for the current list item and its sister items (not its
    parent or children items).

*:MkdnNewListItem*
    `Default mapping: none`
    Adds a new list item below the current line. The new list item will be of
    the same type as the line the cursor is currently on.
    NOTE: |:MkdnEnter| provides a superset of this command's functionality; if
    you have that command mapped, I recommend not mapping this one.

*:MkdnNewListItemBelowInsert*
    `Default mapping: o (Modes: normal)`
    Adds a new list item (or a new line) below the current line and starts
    insert mode. The new list item will be of the same type as the line the
    cursor is currently on.

*:MkdnNewListItemAboveInsert*
    `Default mapping: O (Modes: normal)`
    Adds a new list item (or a new line) above the current line. The new list
    item will be of the same type as the line the cursor is currently on.

*:MkdnExtendList*
    `Default mapping: none`
    Adds a new list item below the current line. This is like
    |:MkdnNewListItem| except that it always adds an _empty_ list item, even
    if it is called when the cursor is in the middle of a list item on the
    current line.

*:MkdnTable* <ncols> <nrows> (<noh>)
    `Default mapping: none`
    Inserts a table into the buffer at the current position of the cursor
    (starting on the following line). Must be called with two arguments: the
    first specifying the number of columns in the table, and the second
    specifying the number of rows. A header row is included automatically and
    is not factored into the row numbers, so calling `:MkdnTable 5 4` will
    result in a five-column table with four rows plus a header row and a
    midrule below the header row. To insert a table without a header or
    midrule row, include "noh(eader)" as a third argument (e.g.
    `MkdnTable 5 4 noh`)

*:MkdnTableFormat*
    `Default mapping: none`
    Formats the table under the cursor. If `tables.format_on_move` is set to
    true in your Mkdnflow config, the Lua function underlying this command is
    triggered. Tables cannot be formatted if not all rows have the same number
    of columns.

*:MkdnTableNextCell*
    `Default mapping: none`
    Moves the cursor to the next cell in the current row, or if the cursor is
    already in the last cell of the current row, moves the cursor to the first
    cell of the next row.
    NOTE: |:MkdnTab| provides a superset of this command's functionality. If
    you have MkdnTab mapped, I recommend leaving this command unmapped.

*:MkdnTablePrevCell*
    `Default mapping: none`
    Moves the cursor to the previous cell in the current row, or if the cursor
    is already in the first cell of the current row, moves the cursor to the
    last cell of the previous row.
    NOTE: MkdnSTab provides a superset of this command's functionality. If you
    have MkdnSTab mapped, I recommend leaving this command unmapped.

*:MkdnTableNewRowBelow*
    `Default mapping: <leader>ir (Modes: normal)`
    Inserts a new empty table row beneath the row the cursor is currently on.
    The new row will have the same number of cells as the current row.

*:MkdnTableNewRowAbove*
    `Default mapping: <leader>iR (Modes: normal)`
    Inserts a new empty table row above the row the cursor is currently on.
    The new row will have the same number of cells as the current row.

*:MkdnTableNewColAfter*
    `Default mapping: <leader>ic (Modes: normal)`
    Inserts a new column following the column the cursor is currently on.

*:MkdnTableNewColBefore*
    `Default mapping: <leader>iC (Modes: normal)`
    Inserts a new column before the column the cursor is currently on.

*:MkdnFoldSection*
    `Default mapping: none`
    Causes the current section (as determined by headings) to be folded. The
    command can be called when the cursor is anywhere in the current section.
    The section or subsection established by the closest heading is what will
    be folded.

*:MkdnUnfoldSection*
    `Default mapping: none`
    Causes the folded section under the cursor to be unfolded.

FEATURES                                                   *Mkdnflow-features*

TWO LINK STYLES                                         *Mkdnflow-link-styles*
- Use either markdown or wiki-link link styles by setting a config option.
- Conceal link sources for either link type by enabling conceal in your config
    - Markdown-style links are shortened from `[Link](source.md)` to `Link`
    - Wiki-style links are shortened from `[[source|Link]]` to `Link` or from
      `[[source]]` to `source`
    - NOTE: If you are using the recently split treesitter parsers for
      markdown (see
      https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter#supported-languages),
      you do not need to enable conceal through mkdnflow if you are using
      markdown-style links. Just make sure you have the `markdown` and
      `markdown_inline` treesitter parsers installed and enabled in markdown
      filetypes, and in your `.vimrc` or `init.lua`, enable conceal
      (`set conceallevel=2` or `vim.wo.conceallevel = 2`).

FOLLOW LINKS AND CITATIONS                             *Mkdnflow-follow-links*
- `<CR>` on various kinds of links to "follow" them:
    - `.md` links open in the current window
    - Absolute links or `.md` links relative to home open in the current
      window but are interpreted with absolute perspective (e.g.
      `[File](/home/user/file.md)`/`[File](C:\Users\user\file.md)` on Windows,
      or `[File](~/Documents/file.md)` otherwise)
    - Links to a file prefixed with `file:` (e.g.
      `[My Xournal notes](file:notes.xopp)`) open with the system's default
      program for that filetype
    - Link to URLs are opened in the default browser
    - Anchor links to headings in the current file will trigger a jump to that
      heading. Headings must start with a hash, and the path part of the link
      must look like the heading with (a) any spaces between the last hash
      mark and the beginning of the heading text removed, (b) all other spaces
      converted to a dash, (c) non-alphanumeric characters removed, (d)
      strings of multiple hashes converted into a single hash, and (e) all
      upper-case characters converted to lower-case characters. For example:
        - `## Bills to pay` will be jumped to if the path in the anchor link
          is `#bills-to-pay`
        - `#### Groceries/other things to buy` will be jumped to if the path
          in the anchor link is `#groceriesother-things-to-buy`
    - Following a link to a directory (e.g. another notebook) will open a
      dialogue for you to select which file in the directory to open in the
      current window
- `<CR>` on citations to open associated files or websites (e.g.
  `@Chomsky1957`, with or without brackets around it)
    - Specify a path to a .bib file in your |Mkdnflow-config|—or if
      `perspective.priority` is `root`, simply place your bib files to be
      searched in your notebook's root directory.
    - Files are prioritized. If no file is found associated with the citation
      key, a URL associated with it will be opened. If no URL is found, a DOI
      is opened. If no DOI is found, whatever is in the `howpublished` field is
      opened.
    - 🔥 Hot tip: make reaching your contacts via work messaging apps (e.g.
      Slack) easier by keeping a bib file that associates your contacts'
      messaging handles with the URL for your direct message thread with that
      contact. For instance, if you point the plugin to a bib file with the
      following entry, `<CR>`ing on `@dschrute` in a markdown document would
      take you to the associated Slack thread.

        url={https://dundermifflin.slack.com/archives/P07BFJD82}
    }
<
CUSTOMIZABLE LINK INTERPRETATION                        *Mkdnflow-perspective*
- Specify what perspective the plugin-should take when interpreting links to
  files. There are three options:
    1. Interpret links relative to the first-opened file (default behavior;
    similar to #3 if your first-opened file is always in the root
    directory)
    2. Interpret links relative to the file open in the current buffer
    3. Interpret links relative to the root directory of the notebook that the
    file in the current buffer is a part of. To enable this functionality, set
    `perspective.priority` to `root` in your config, and pass a file as the
    value of `perspective.root_tell`. The _tell_ is the name of a single file
    that can be used to identify the root directory (e.g. `index.md`, `.git`,
    `.root`, `.wiki_root`, etc.). See the default |Mkdnflow-config| for how to
    configure the `perspective` table.
    - Override any of the above settings by specifying a link to a markdown
      file with an absolute path (one that starts with `/` or `~/`). Links
      within this file will still receive the relative interpretation, so this
      is best for references out of the project directory to markdown files
      without their own dependencies (unless those dependencies are within the
      project directory).
- Keep your files organized **and** your links simple by customizing link
  interpretation using an implicit transformation function (see
  |Mkdnflow-config|).

CREATE OR CUSTOMIZE OR DESTROY LINKS
- `<CR>` on word under cursor or visual selection to create a notebook-
  internal link
    - Customizable path text transformations (by default, text is converted to
      lowercase, spaces are converted to dashes, and the date in YYYY-MM-DD
      format is prefixed to the filename, separated by an underscore). See the
      description of the [`links`](#links-dictionary-like-table) config key
      for customization instructions.
- `<M-CR>` (Alt-Enter) when your cursor is anywhere in a link to destroy it
  (replace it with the text in [...])
- Create an anchor link if the visual selection starts with `#` 
- Create a web link if what's under the cursor is a URL (and move the cursor
  to enter the link name)
- `ya` on a heading to add a formatted anchor link for the heading to the
  default register (ready to paste in the current buffer)
    - `yfa` to do the same, but adding the absolute path of the file before
      the anchor (for pasting in another buffer)
- Customize how link sources are generated from text using a custom explicit
  transformation function
    - Adding the following to your setup would result in a link that looks
      like the following: `[Some text](sometext.md)`
>
    require('mkdnflow').setup({
        links = {
            transform_explicit = function(text)
                -- Make lowercase, remove spaces, and reverse the string
                return string.lower(text:gsub(' ', '')
            end
        }
    })
<
JUMP TO LINKS AND HEADINGS                                  *Mkdnflow-jumping*
- `<Tab>` and `<S-Tab>` jump to the next and previous links in the file
- `]]` and `[[` jump to the next and previous headings in the file
- "Wrap" back to the beginning/end of the file when jumping with a config
  setting (see |Mkdnflow-config|)

CREATE MISSING DIRECTORIES                      *Mkdnflow-create-missing-dirs*
- If a link goes to a file in a directory that doesn't exist, it can
  optionally be created (see `create_dirs` in |Mkdnflow-config|)

RENAME LINK SOURCES AND FILES SIMULTANEOUSLY                 *Mkdnflow-rename*
- Use built-in dialog triggered by `MkdnMoveSource` (mapped to `<F2>` by
  default) to rename a link's source and rename/move the linked file
  simultaneously
    - `perspective`, `implicit extensions`, and custom
      `implicit transformations` are all taken into account when moving the
      linked file
    - The dialog will confirm the details of the changes for you to
      approve/reject before taking any action

BACKWARD AND FORWARD NAVIGATION THROUGH BUFFERS   *Mkdnflow-buffer-navigation*
- `<BS>` to go backward (to the previous file/buffer opened in the current
  window, like clicking the back button in a web browser)
- `<Del>` to go forward (to the subsequent file/buffer opened in the current
  window, like clicking the forward button in a web browser)

KEYBINDINGS
- Easy-to-remember default keybindings that activate only in markdown
  files (and/or other filetypes you specify in the `filetypes` config
  table)
- Customize keybindings individually or disable them altogether by disabling
  the `maps` module)

MANIPULATE HEADINGS
- Increase/decrease heading levels (mapped to `+`/`-` by default).
  NOTE: Increasing the heading means increasing it in importance (i.e. making
  it bigger or more prominent when converted to HTML and rendered in a
  browser), which counterintuitively means removing a hash symbol.

SECTION FOLDING                                             *Mkdnflow-folding*
- Fold a section using `<CR>` in normal mode if the cursor is on the heading
  of the section
    - Unfold a folded section using `<CR>` or `<leader>F` (both are default
      mappings; the former maps to a wrapper function that will follow links
      if the cursor is not on a fold or section heading; the latter is mapped
        specifically to `:MkdnUnfoldSection<CR>`)
    - If you wish to create a link in a heading (normally done with `<CR>`),
      you'll need to do so by making a visual selection of the text you wish
      to create a link from and then hitting `<CR>`, or otherwise disabling
      the mapping for `MkdnEnter` and mapping `MkdnFollowLink` to `<CR>` in
      visual and normal modes.
- Fold the section the cursor is currently in—even if the cursor is not on the
  heading—using `<leader>f`

LISTS                                                         *Mkdnflow-lists*
- Toggle the status of a to-do list item on the current line (mapped to
  `<C-Space>` by default). Using the default settings, toggling will result in
  the following changes. To-do symbols can be customized (make sure to use the
  luautf8 luarock dependency if you want to use utf8 to-do symbols).
    - `- [ ] ...` → `- [-] ...`
    - `- [-] ...` → `- [X] ...`
    - `- [X] ...` → `- [ ] ...`
- Toggle multiple to-do items at once by selecting the lines to toggle in
  (simple) visual mode (mapped to `<C-Space>` by default)
- Create to-do items from plain unordered or ordered lists by toggling a
  non-to-do-list item (`<C-Space>` by default)
- Automatically update any parent to-dos when child to-dos are toggled.
    - When all child to-dos have been marked complete, the parent is marked
      complete
    - When at least one child to-do has been marked in-progress, the parent
      to-do is marked in-progress
    - When a parent to-do is marked complete and one child to-do is reverted
      to not-yet-started or in-progress, the parent to-do is marked in-progress
    - When a parent to-do is marked complete or in-progress and all child
      to-dos have been reverted to not-yet-started, the parent to-do is marked
      not-yet-started.
- Update numbering for the list the cursor is currently on
    - `<leader>nn` (default mapping) or `:MkdnUpdateNumbering 0<CR>`, e.g., if
      you want to start numbering at 0
- Smart(er) behavior when `<CR>`ing in lists
    - In unordered lists: Add another bullet on the next line, unless the
      current list item is empty, in which case it will be erased
    - In ordered lists: Add another item on the next line (keeping numbering
      updated), unless the current item is empty, in which case it will be
      erased
    - In unordered and ordered to-do lists: Add another to-do item on the next
      line, unless the current to-do is empty, in which case it will be
      replaced with a simple (non-to-do) list item
    - Automatically indent a new list item when the current one ends in a colon
    - Demote empty indented list items by reducing the indentation by one level
- Add new list items using the list type of the current line without any of
  the fancy stuff listed above (see |:MkdnExtendList|)
- Use |:MkdnNewListItemBelowInsert| and |:MkdnNewListItemAboveInsert| (mapped
  to `o` and `O` by default, respectively) to insert new list items (or new
  lines if not in a list) and begin insert mode

TABLES                                                       *Mkdnflow-tables*
- Create a markdown table of `x` columns and `y` rows with `:MkdnTable x y`.
  Table headers are added automatically; to exclude headers, use
  `:MkdnTable x y noh`
- Format existing tables with `:MkdnTableFormat`
- Jump forward and backward between cells (mapped to `<Tab>` and `<S-Tab>` in
  insert mode by default)
- Jump forward and backward between rows (mapped to `<CR>` and `<M-CR>` in
  insert mode by default)
- Optionally trim extra whitespace from a cell when formatting (see
  |Mkdnflow-config|)
- Optionally disable formatting when moving cells
- Add new rows or columns (before or after the current row/cell; see
  |Mkdnflow-commands| for default mappings to these functions

DISABLE UNUSED MODULES                                      *Mkdnflow-modules*
- Individually disable any of the modules that enable all of the above
  functionality (see description of this option in |Mkdnflow-config|)
    - Prevents the module from being loaded (rather than simply disabling the
      functionality the module provides)
    - Disabling a module prevents commands that are dependent on that module
      from being defined (and prevents mappings to those commands from being
      set)

CAVEATS AND WARNINGS                                        *Mkdnflow-caveats*
                                                           *Mkdnflow-warnings*

The plugin won't start automatically if the first-opened file is not one of
the default or named extensions (see Configuration), but you can manually
start the plugin with the defined command `:MkdnFlow`.

The plugin should now work on Windows, but should you encounter any problems
with the expected functionality, please file an issue!

LUA FUNCTIONS                                         *Mkdnflow-lua-functions*

NOTE: This section is under construction. Not all currently-defined Lua
functions are described here.

Mkdnflow utilizes the following public Lua functions under the hood. The only
one that is intended to be used directly is the setup function. The functions
following that are utilized when the commands are called.

The following functions are defined in one of the module files but are
ultimately returned as part of the table defined in `init.lua` for public use,
such as for reference by the vim user commands the plugin defines.

require("mkdnflow").setup(table)~
    Initializes the plugin using a configuration specified in the argument (a
    table), but only if the filetype of the current buffer is matched in the
    list of filetypes specified in the table (or one of the defaults).
    Providing an empty table initializes the plugin using the defaults.

require("mkdnflow").forceStart()~
    Initializes the plugin using a configuration specified in the argument (a
    table), regardless of what the current filetype is. Providing an empty
    table initializes the plugin using the defaults.

require("mkdnflow").links.createLink()~
    Makes a link from the word under the cursor--or, if no word is under the
    cursor, produces the syntax for a md link: `[](<prefix->.md)`. If there's
    a URL under the cursor, the whole URL is made into a link. Returns nothing
    via std out, but inserts text into the vim buffer.

require("mkdnflow").links.followLink()~
    Does something with the path in the link under the cursor. If the path is
    a filename, it creates the file specified in the path. If the path is a
    URL, it uses `path_handler()` to open the URL specified in the path. If
    the path is determined to be neither the filename for a text file nor a
    URL, it uses `path_handler()` to open a local file at the specified path
    via the system's default application for that filetype. Returns nothing.

require("mkdnflow").buffers.goBack()~
    Uses the main buffer stack to go to the last-opened buffer.

require("mkdnflow").buffers.goForward()~
    Uses the historical buffer stack to go to the last-opened buffer.

require("mkdnflow").cursor.toNextLink()~
    Finds the next link in the file.

require("mkdnflow").cursor.toPrevLink()~
    Finds the previous link in the file.

require("mkdnflow").cursor.changeHeadingLevel("increase")~
    Increases heading level importance (removes hashes)

require("mkdnflow").cursor.changeHeadingLevel("decrease")~
    Decreases heading level importance (adds hashes)

require("mkdnflow").lists.toggleToDo()~
    Toggle a to-do list item's completion status

require("mkdnflow").lists.newListItem(~
    carry, above, cursor_moves, mode_after, alt~
)~
    Insert a new list item. Parameters this function accepts:
    {carry} (boolean): whether material following the cursor on the current
    line should be brought to the new line
    {above} (boolean): whether the new line should be inserted above the
    current line
    {cursor_moves} (boolean): whether the cursor should move to the new line
    {mode_after} (string): which mode the editor should be in after the line
    is created and the cursor is moved (`'i'` or `'n'`)
    {alt} (string): keys to feed if the function is called when the current
    line is not part of a list (e.g. `'<CR>'` or `'o'`)

CONFIGURATION                                         *Mkdnflow-configuration*
                                                      *Mkdnflow-config*
                                                      *Mkdnflow-setup*

To use Mkdnflow with the default behavior, just call the setup function in your
init config and provide an empty table.
>
    require('mkdnflow').setup({})
>
To change Mkdnflow's behavior, you can change any of the following elements by
specifying a new value for them in the table passed to the setup function.
There is no need to provide values for everything; any settings you pass to
the setup function will override defaults for those specific settings.

    - `modules.conceal` (required if you wish to enable link concealing; note
      that you must declare `links.conceal` as `true` in addition to enabling
      this module if you wish to conceal links)
                                              *Mkdnflow-config-modules-cursor*
    - `modules.cursor` (required for jumping to links and headings; yanking
      anchor links)
                                               *Mkdnflow-config-modules-folds*
    - `modules.folds` (required for folding by section)

      following links)
                                               *Mkdnflow-config-modules-lists*
    - `modules.lists` (required for manipulating lists, toggling to-do list
      items, etc.)
                                                *Mkdnflow-config-modules-maps*
    - `modules.maps` (required for setting mappings via the mappings table;
      set to `false` if you wish to set mappings outside of the plugin)
                                               *Mkdnflow-config-modules-paths*
    - `modules.paths` (required for link interpretation and following links)

    - `modules.tables` (required for table navigation and formatting)
- Modules not enabled by default:
                                                *Mkdnflow-config-modules-yaml*
    - `modules.yaml` (required for parsing yaml blocks)

`create_dirs` (boolean)~
                                                 *Mkdnflow-config-create_dirs*
- `true`: Directories referenced in a link will be (recursively) created if
  they do not exist
- `false` No action will be taken when directories referenced in a link do not
  exist. Neovim will open a new file, but you will get an error when you
  attempt to write the file.

`perspective` (dictionary-like table)~
                                                 *Mkdnflow-config-perspective*
                                        *Mkdnflow-config-perspective-priority*
- `perspective.priority` (string): Specifies the priority perspective to take
  when interpreting link paths
    - `'first'`: Links will be interpreted relative to the first-opened file
      (when the current instance of Neovim was started)
    - `'current'`: Links will be interpreted relative to the current file
    - `'root'`: Links will be interpreted relative to the root directory of
      the current notebook (requires `perspective.root_tell` to be specified)

                                                *Mkdnflow-config-nvim_wd_heel*
- `'nvim_wd_heel'` (boolean): Specifies whether changes in perspective will
  result in corresponding changes to Neovim's working directory
    - `true`: Changes in perspective will be reflected in the nvim
      working directory. (In other words, the working directory will "heel"
      to the plugin's perspective.) This helps ensure (at least) that path
      completions (if using a completion plugin with support for paths) will
      be accurate and usable.
    - `false`: Neovim's working directory will not be affected by Mkdnflow

                                        *Mkdnflow-config-perspective-fallback*
- `perspective.fallback` (string): Specifies the backup perspective to take if
  priority isn't possible (e.g. if it is `'root'` but no root directory is
  found)
    - `'first'`: (see above)
    - `'current'`: (see above)
    - `'root'`: (see above)
                                       *Mkdnflow-config-perspective-root_tell*
- `perspective.root_tell` (string or boolean)
    - `'<any file name>'`: Any arbitrary filename by which the plugin can
      uniquely identify the root directory of the current notebook. If `false`
      is used instead, the plugin will never search for a root directory, even
      if `perspective.priority` is set to `root`.

`filetypes` (dictionary-like table)~
                                                   *Mkdnflow-config-filetypes*
- `<any arbitrary filetype extension>` (boolean value)
    - `true`: A matching extension will enable the plugin's functionality for
      a file with that extension

NOTE: This functionality references the file's extension. It does not rely on
Neovim's filetype recognition. The extension must be provided in lower case
because the plugin converts file names to lowercase. Any arbitrary extension
can be supplied. Setting an extension to `false` is the same as not including
it in the list.

`wrap` (boolean)~
                                                        *Mkdnflow-config-wrap*
- `true`: When jumping to next/previous links or headings, the cursor will
  continue searching at the beginning/end of the file
- `false`: When jumping to next/previous links or headings, the cursor will
  stop searching at the end/beginning of the file

`bib` (dictionary-like table)~
                                                         *Mkdnflow-config-bib*
                                            *Mkdnflow-config-bib-default_path*
- `bib.default_path` (string or `nil`): Specifies a path to a default .bib
  file to look for citation keys in (need not be in root directory of
  notebook)
                                            *Mkdnflow-config-bib-find_in_root*
- `bib.find_in_root` (boolean)
    - `true`: When `perspective.priority` is also set to `root` (and a root
      directory was found), the plugin will search for bib files to reference
      in the notebook's top-level directory. If `bib.default_path` is also
      specified, the default path will be appended to the list of bib files
      found in the top level directory so that it will also be searched.
    - `false`: The notebook's root directory will not be searched for bib
      files.

`silent` (boolean)~
                                                      *Mkdnflow-config-silent*
- `true`: The plugin will not display any messages in the console except
  compatibility warnings related to your config
- `false`: The plugin will display messages to the console (all messages from
  the plugin start with ⬇️ )

`links` (dictionary-like table)~
                                                       *Mkdnflow-config-links*
                                                 *Mkdnflow-config-links-style*
- `links.style` (string)
    - `'markdown'`: Links will be expected in the standard markdown format:
      `[<title>](<source>)`
    - `'wiki'`: Links will be expected in the unofficial wiki-link style,
      specifically the title-after-pipe format (see 
      https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/pull/7705): `[[<source>|<title>]]`.
                                               *Mkdnflow-config-links-conceal*
- `links.conceal` (boolean)
    - `true`: Link sources and delimiters will be concealed (depending on
      which link style is selected)
    - `false`: Link sources and delimiters will not be concealed by mkdnflow
                                               *Mkdnflow-config-links-context*
- `links.context` (number)
    - `0` (default): When following or jumping to links, assume that no link
      will be split over multiple lines
    - `n`: When following or jumping to links, consider `n` lines before and
      after a given line (useful if you ever permit links to be interrupted by
      a hard line break)
                                    *Mkdnflow-config-links-implicit_extension*
- `links.implicit_extension` (string)
    - `<any extension>`: A string that instructs the plugin (a) how to
      interpret links to files that do not have an extension, and (b) that new
      links should be created without an explicit extension
                                    *Mkdnflow-config-links-transform_explicit*
- `links.transform_explicit` (function or `false`): A function that transforms
  the text to be inserted as the source/path of a link when a link is created.
  Anchor links are not currently customizable. If you want all link paths to
  be explicitly prefixed with the year, for instance, and for the path to be
  converted to uppercase, you could provide the following function under this
  key. (NOTE: The previous functionality specified under the `prefix` key has
  been migrated here to provide greater flexibility.)
>
    function(input)
        return(string.upper(os.date('%Y-')..input))
    end
<
                                    *Mkdnflow-config-links-transform_implicit*
- `links.transform_implicit` (function or `false`): A function that transforms
  the path of a link immediately before interpretation. It does not transform
  the actual text in the buffer but can be used to modify link interpretation.
  For instance, link paths that match a date pattern can be opened in a
  `journals` subdirectory of your notebook, and all others can be opened in a
  `pages` subdirectory, using the following function:
>
    function(input)
        if input:match('%d%d%d%d%-%d%d%-%d%d') then
            return('journals/'..input)
        else
            return('pages/'..input)
        end
    end
<
`to_do` (dictionary-like table)~
                                                        *Mkdnfow-config-to-do*
                                               *Mkdnflow-config-to-do-symbols*
- `to_do.symbols` (array-like table): A list of symbols (each no more than one
  character) that represent to-do list completion statuses. `MkdnToggleToDo`
  references these when toggling the status of a to-do item. Three are
  expected: one representing not-yet-started to-dos (default: `' '`), one
  representing in-progress to-dos (default: `-`), and one representing
  complete to-dos (default: `X`).
    - NOTE: Native Lua support for UTF-8 characters is limited, so in order
      to ensure all functionality works as intended if you are using non-ascii
      to-do symbols, you'll need to install the luarocks module "luautf8".
                                        *Mkdnflow-config-to-do-update_parents*
- `to_do.update_parents` (boolean): Whether parent to-dos' statuses should be
  updated based on child to-do status changes performed via `MkdnToggleToDo`
    - `true` (default): Parent to-do statuses will be inferred and
      automatically updated when a child to-do's status is changed
    - `false`: To-do items can be toggled, but parent to-do statuses (if any)
      will not be automatically changed
- The following entries can be used to stipulate which symbols shall be used
  when updating a parent to-do's status when a child to-do's status is
  changed. These are **not required**: if `to_do.symbols` is customized but
  these options are not provided, the plugin will attempt to infer what the
  meanings of the symbols in your list are by their order. For example, if you
  set `to_do.symbols` as `{' ', '⧖', '✓'}`, `' '` will be assiged to
  `to_do.not_started`, '⧖' will be assigned to `to_do.in_progress`, etc. If
  more than three symbols are specified, the first will be used as
  `not_started`, the second will be used as `in_progress`, and the last will
  be used as `complete`. If two symbols are provided (e.g. `' ', '✓'`), the
  first will be used as both `not_started` and `in_progress`, and the second
  will be used as `complete`.
    - `to_do.not_started` (string): Stipulates which symbol represents a
      not-yet-started to-do
    - `to_do.in_progress` (string):  Stipulates which symbol represents an
      in-progress to-do
    - `to_do.complete` (string):  Stipulates which symbol represents a
      complete to-do

`tables` (dictionary-like table)~

                                      *Mkdnflow-config-tables-trim_whitespace*
- `tables.trim_whitespace` (boolean): Whether extra whitespace should be
  trimmed from the end of a table cell when a table is formatted (default:
  `true`)
                                       *Mkdnflow-config-tables-format_on_move*
- `tables.format_on_move` (boolean): Whether tables should be formatted each
  time the cursor is moved via MkdnTableNext/PrevCell or
  MkdnTableNext/Prev/Row (default: `true`)
                                     *Mkdnflow-config-tables-auto_extend_rows*
                                     *Mkdnflow-config-tables-auto_extend_cols*
- tables.auto_extend_rows (boolean): Whether a new row should automatically be
  added to a table when `:MkdnTableNextRow` is triggered when the cursor is in
  the final row of the table. If `false`, the cursor will simply leave the
  table for the next line. (default: `false`)
- tables.auto_extend_cols (boolean): Whether a new column should automatically
  be added to a table when `:MkdnTableNextCell` is triggered when the cursor
  is in the final column of the table. If false, the cursor will jump to the
  first cell of the next row, unless the cursor is already in the last row, in
  which case nothing will happen. (default: `false`)

`yaml (dictionary-like table)`~
                                                        *Mkdnflow-config-yaml*

                                           *Mkdnflow-config-yaml-bib-override*
    - `yaml.bib.override` (boolean): Whether or not a bib path specified in a
      yaml block should be the only source considered for bib references in
      that file (default: `false`)

NOTE: See |Mkdnflow-mappings|

`mappings` (dictionary-like table)~
                                                  *Mkdnflow-config-mappings*
- `mappings.<name of command>` (array-like table or `false`)
    - `mappings.<name of command>[1]` string or array table representing the
      mode (or array of modes) that the mapping should apply in (`'n'`, `'v'`,
      etc.)
    - `mappings.<name of command>[2]` string representing the keymap (e.g.
      `'<Space>'`)
    - set `mappings.<name of command> = false` to disable default mapping
      without providing a custom mapping

NOTE: `<name of command>` should be the name of a commands defined in
`mkdnflow.nvim/plugin/mkdnflow.lua` (see :h Mkdnflow-commands for a list).

RECOMMENDED VIM SETTINGS                   *Mkdnflow-recommended-vim-settings*

I recommended turning on `autowriteall` in Neovim *for markdown filetypes*.
This will ensure that changes to buffers are saved when you navigate away from
that buffer, e.g. by following a link to another file. See `:h awa`. If you
have `hidden` enabled or if a buffer is hidden by `bufhidden`, you may need to
use the second option (thanks, @vandalt).

One way to do this would be to use an autocmd, such as below (in a Lua file):
>
    vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd("FileType", {pattern = "markdown", command = "set awa"})
    -- Use the following if your buffer is set to become hidden
    --vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd("BufLeave", {pattern = "*.md", command = "silent! wall"})
<
Or the following (in a Vimscript file):
>
    autocmd FileType markdown set autowriteall
    " Use the following if your buffer is set to become hidden
    " autocmd BufLeave *.md silent! wall
>

RECENT BREAKING CHANGES                                     *Mkdnflow-changes*

commit e9f78158a68cdb6740cf2442541cdfeada68bd6c~
Author: Jake Vincent <jakewvincent@gmail.com>
Date:   Thu May 12 21:16:26 2022 -0700

Previously, just one bib file could be specified via the `default_bib_path`
key. Now any number of bib files can be searched, as long as they are in the
project's top-level directory and as long as `perspective.priority` is set to
`root`. This is enabled by default, but the setting can be turned off in the
following way. Also note in the sample config below that default_bib_path has
now been migrated to the `default_path` key under the table called `bib`:
>
    require('mkdnflow').setup({
        bib = {
            default_path = nil,
            find_in_root = true
        }
    })

Previously, a customizable prefix could be specified in your config. The
default settings were as follows:
>
    require('mkdnflow').setup({
        prefix = {
            evaluate = true,
            string = [[os.date('%Y-%m-%d_')]]
        }
    })
<
This functionality has now been relocated into a much more flexible
transformation function, which will not only allow you to add any prefix or
suffix that you wish, but also transform the text of the path of a link in any
way you like. The default behavior is still the same. To use your own
transformation, you would specify it under the `transform_explicit` key in the
new links `table`. To add a prefix that is just the month, for instance, and
to maintain the default behavior of transforming spaces to dashes and
converting upper-case characters to lower case characters, you would specify
the following in your config. If you want to maintain the default behavior
completely, you should remove the `prefix` key from your config (if it is
there) and avoid providing a value for `transform_explicit` so that the
default value for it is used.
>
    require('mkdnflow').setup({
        links = {
            transform_explicit = function(text)
                text = text:gsub(' ', '-')
                text = text:lower()
                text = os.date('%m_')..text
                return(text)
            end
        }
    })

Author: Jake Vincent <jakewvincent@gmail.com>
Date:   Mon Apr 25 11:10:48 2022 -0700

There were previously two settings related to file prefixes that were
specified separately in an instructured way:
>
    require('mkdnflow').setup({
        evaluate_prefix = true,
        new_file_prefix = [[string]]
    })
<
After this commit, these settings must be set by passing a table to the new
`prefix` key, as follows:
>
    require('mkdnflow').setup({
        prefix = {
            evaluate = true,
            string = [[string]]
        }
    })

Previously, the plugin's behavior around how links are interpreted was
affected by the value of the `links_relative_to` key. This feature is now
named `perspective`, and you can now request that the plugin try to interpret
links relative to the root of your wiki, where the root directory is flagged
by what I've called a "tell"--a specific file that resides in your root
directory, such as one that would normally occur in a project's root (such as
`.git`). However, the tell is arbitrary. You can set it as `index.md` if you
have an index file in your root directory, or an empty file named
`.wiki_root`. The new `perspective` key is specified as follows:
>
    require('mkdnflow').setup({
        perspective = {
            priority = 'root',
            fallback = 'current',
            root_tell = 'some-file-that-can-uniquely-id-your-notebook-root'
        }
    })

Date:   Mon Apr 25 10:40:39 2022 -0700

The two previous settings `wrap_to_beginning` and `wrap_to_end` are now a
single settings `wrap` since in all likelihood anyone who wishes the cursor to
jump to the beginning of the file when searching for links or headings also
would want the cursor to jump to the end of the document what searching for
links or headings in reverse. You'll need to replace both of those settings
(if you have them set to true) with `wrap`, which also takes a boolean. The
default is still false.

This commit contained a revision to the way mappings are provided for each
command so that the mode for the mapping can be specified (e.g. normal,
visual, etc.). Previously the mapping was passed as the value in a table for a
particular command. The key in the mappings table should still be named
exactly after a command, but a table should be passed to them, the first value
of which is a single mode (e.g. 'n') or a table with multiple modes (e.g.
{'n', 'v'}), and the second value should be a string representing the mapping.
Example:
>
  {
    mappings = {
      MkdnToggleToDo = {'n', '<Space>'},
      MkdnCreateLink = {{'n', 'v'}, '<leader>l'}
    }
  }

A compatibility function in the `compat.lua` module will (for now) migrate any
of the old config types to the new type each time the plugin is started.

commit c1cf25f061e29be5ed7b9e5d44e5f0f427d46444~

This commit contained a reorganization of the function in `files.lua` that was
called followPath(). The higher-level functionality of followPath() was
shipped off to a new function called followLink(), which is located in the new
links module. The vim command MkdnFollowPath was at around the same time
changed to MkdnFollowLink. If you have any custom commands or references to
either MkdnFollowPath or files.followPath(), please use MkdnFollowLink and/
or links.followLink() from now on.


commit 75c8ecc5c81bd048b6cd452f30ebde54db258165~
Author: Jake Vincent <jakewvincent@gmail.com>
Date:   Fri Apr 22 13:32:54 2022 -0700

Starting in this commit, mkdnflow now expects the `perspective` key in your
config (or in the default config) to point to a table, rather than a string
(see |Mkdnflow-configuration|). For now, if you have customized `perspective`
and it currently points to a string (i.e. 'first' or 'current'), a
compatibility function will read your config and (internally) convert it into
the expected format before overwriting the default settings with any you
specify.

commit 511e8ed5a89a1d117ae4ff3e93cf3d1d14338a1c~
Author: Jake Vincent <jakewvincent@gmail.com>
Date:   Thu Apr 21 20:16:39 2022 -0700

In this commit, the growing `files.lua` module was split into three separate
modules to improve organization. Link-related functions were moved into
`links.lua`, buffer-related ones into `buffers.lua`, and path-related ones
into `paths.lua`. The only reason you're likely to be reading this is if you
received a friendly warning about referencing files.goBack() or
files.goForward(). A compatibility module was added to temporarily ensure
compatibility, but you should replace any references to `files` with
references to `buffers`. For instance:

  `require('mkdnflow').files.goBack()` -> `require('mkdnflow').buffers.goBack()`
  `require('mkdnflow').files.goForward()` -> `require('mkdnflow').buffers.goForward()`
